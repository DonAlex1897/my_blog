I’ve been thinking about starting a personal blog for a long time.

Not because I wanted to “build a brand”, but because I kept running into the same problem:  
I learn things, I solve problems, and then a few months later I forget the details.

This blog is my attempt to fix that.

## Why a blog at all?

Most of my learning happens while:
- building side projects
- debugging something annoying
- revisiting concepts I thought I already understood

Writing forces clarity.  
If I can’t explain something clearly, I usually don’t understand it well enough.

This blog is mainly for:
- future me
- other developers who think similarly
- anyone curious enough to read

## Why not a CMS?

I’m a developer. I don’t need:
- a web editor
- a database
- authentication
- an admin panel

I need:
- files
- version control
- a fast way to publish

Markdown + Git already solve those problems extremely well.

If writing a post takes more than a few minutes to publish, I simply won’t do it.

## Why static?

This site is built as a static site on purpose.

That means:
- no backend
- no runtime server logic
- content is generated at build time

The benefits are boring, which is exactly what I want:
- fast
- cheap
- secure
- very little to maintain

I can always add more later.  
I can’t easily remove complexity once it’s there.

## What I’ll write about

Mostly:
- software development
- .NET and frontend work
- architectural tradeoffs
- things I learn and want to remember

Occasionally:
- productivity
- learning
- thoughts that don’t fit neatly into “tech”

## Closing thoughts

This blog is intentionally simple.

If it turns into something more, that’s fine.  
If it stays small and quiet, that’s also fine.

The important part is that it exists — and that I actually use it.
